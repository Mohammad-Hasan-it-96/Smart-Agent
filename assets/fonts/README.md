# Arabic Fonts for PDF Generation

To enable Arabic text support in PDFs, please download the Cairo font and place it here:

1. Download Cairo font from: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cairo
2. Extract the font files
3. Place `Cairo-Regular.ttf` in this directory (`assets/fonts/`)

Alternatively, you can use:
- Amiri font: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Amiri
- Noto Sans Arabic: https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Arabic

Make sure the font file is named exactly as specified in `pubspec.yaml` and `pdf_exporter.dart`.
